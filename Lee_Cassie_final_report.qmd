# Introduction

Air pollution is the presence of sufficient quantities of contaminants in the atmosphere for a duration that is long enough to cause harm to human health.[^1] Air pollution mainly enters the body through the lungs, and while it mostly impacts the heart, lungs, and brain, it has the potential to affect other organs as well by traveling through the bloodstream.[^2]

This EDA explores the relationships between air quality indicators, certain lung diseases, and how sociodemographic vulnerabilities affect the relationships between air quality and health in the United States (excluding territories). The goal of this analysis is to build a deeper understanding of how various air pollutants impact health across the United States.

The data was queried and downloaded from the CDC National Environmental Public Health Tracking Network interactive data explorer.[^3] This network was built to centralize environmental health data on the national, state, and county level across the United States.[^4]

The three central questions explored in this analysis were:

1.  How are various air quality indicators related to each other?

2.  What are the most important indicators for determining the prevalence of asthma, cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease?

3.  How do sociodemographics like age, gender, race, and socioeconomic vulnerability affect the relationships between air quality and health outcomes?

# Data overview & quality

All data was downloaded at the county level for 2018. 

The air pollutants selected includes the days over the ozone standard, the percent of days over the PM 2.5 standard, benzene, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, carbon tetrachloride, and 1,3-butadiene pollution. Environmental quality indicators selected includes the percent of people living near highways, the percent of public schools near highways, access to parks, and methods of transportation to work (walking, biking, driving alone, carpooling, public transportation, and none).

The indicators selected for prevalence of lung diseases includes the crude prevalence of adult and child asthma, the crude and age adjusted rates of emergency department visits for asthma, age adjusted rates of lung and bronchus cancer, and the crude and age adjusted rates of chronic pulmonary obstructive disease. 

The indicators of sociodemographic data selected includes age, gender, race, and and the social vulnerability index[^5].
