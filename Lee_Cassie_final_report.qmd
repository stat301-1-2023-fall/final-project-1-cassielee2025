# Introduction

Air pollution is the presence of sufficient quantities of contaminants in the atmosphere for a duration that is long enough to cause harm to human health.[^1] Air pollution mainly enters the body through the lungs, and while it mostly impacts the heart, lungs, and brain, it has the potential to affect other organs as well by traveling through the bloodstream.[^2]

In the EDA, I explore the relationships between air quality indicators, certain lung diseases, and how sociodemographic vulnerabilities affect the relationships between air quality and health in the United States (excluding territories). The goal of this analysis is to build a deeper understanding of how various air pollutants impact health across the United States.

I queried the data at the county level and downloaded from the CDC National Environmental Public Health Tracking Network interactive data explorer.[^3] This network was built to centralize environmental health data on the national, state, and county level across the United States.[^4]

The three central questions I explored in this analysis were:

1.  How are various air and environmental quality indicators related to each other?

2.  What are the most important indicators for determining the prevalence of asthma, cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease?

3.  How do sociodemographics like age, gender, race, and socioeconomic vulnerability affect the relationships between air quality and health outcomes?

# Data overview & quality

The air pollutants I selected includes the days over the ozone standard, the percent of days over the PM 2.5 standard, benzene, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, carbon tetrachloride, and 1,3-butadiene pollution. The environmental quality indicators I selected includes the percent of people living near highways, the percent of public schools near highways, access to parks, and methods of transportation to work (walking, biking, driving alone, carpooling, public transportation, and none).

The indicators I selected for prevalence of lung diseases includes the crude prevalence of adult and child asthma, the crude and age adjusted rates of emergency department visits for asthma, age adjusted rates of lung and bronchus cancer, and the crude and age adjusted rates of chronic pulmonary obstructive disease.

The indicators of sociodemographic data I selected includes age, gender, race, and and the social vulnerability index[^5]. I compared sociodemographic characteristics of each county to other counties in the United States and used this to identify counties with comparatively higher percentages of vulnerable groups (Appendix A). I also identified the majority race demographic in each county.

[^5]: [CDC/ATSDR Social Vulnerability Index](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/placeandhealth/svi/index.html)

If available, I downloaded all data at the county level for 2018. Crude rates of child asthma and age adjusted rates of lung and bronchus cancer were only available at the state level. I downloaded data for the usual method of transportation to work for the time period of 2017 to 2021.

The final merged dataset includes 42 variables and 3144 observations matching each county and Washington DC. There are 4 identifying variables, 5 factor variables, 32 numeric variables, and one simple features geometry variable for mapping.

With the exception of Rio Arriba, Mexico, all counties have complete sociodemographic information. Rio Arriba, Mexico is missing data for the social vulnerability index. The prevalence of adult asthma is complete across all observations, but 1402 observations are missing for the prevalence of child asthma and 1789 observations are missing for crude and age adjusted emergency department visits for asthma. The majority of counties do not have information about the days over the ozone and PM 2.5 air quality standards. 1567 observations are missing data for the percent of public school near highways. All other variables are either complete or missing at most 1 observation.

# Explorations

## Indicators of air and environmental quality

As seen in @fig-days-over-distribution, the distribution of days over the ozone and particulate matter size 2.5 microns (PM 2.5) standards are both skewed right by observations with significantly more days over the standard. For both ozone and PM 2.5, most of the counties experienced no more than 20 days over the standard. However, the degree of right skewing for the distribution of days over ozone standard is significantly higher than for the distribution of days over the PM 2.5 standard.

```{r}
#| label: fig-days-over-distribution
#| fig-cap: Distribution of days over air quality standards.

p1 <- full_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(days_over_o3_standard)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, boundary = 0, fill = "#def5e5ff") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Days over ozone standard",
    x = "Days",
    y = NULL
  )

p2 <- full_data %>% 
  mutate(pm_standard = days_over_pm_standard/100 * 365) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(pm_standard)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, boundary = 0, fill = "#ed6925") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Days over PM 2.5 standard",
    x = "Days",
    y = NULL
  )

p1 + p2
```

Given that the distribution is so heavily skewed right, I was interested to see the distribution of the days over the ozone and PM 2.5 standards across the US. Although most of the data is missing, it is clear that Southern California has high levels of ozone pollution and Central California has high levels of PM 2.5 pollution. For PM 2.5, the days over the PM 2.5 standard aligns with the California wildfire incident map in 2018.[^8]

  coord_sf(
    xlim = c(-125, -65), 
    ylim = c(20, 50)
  ) + 
  theme_void() + 
  scale_fill_viridis("Log of days over\nozone standard", option = "mako") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of ozone pollution") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

p4 <- full_data %>% 
  mutate(pm_standard = days_over_pm_standard/100 * 365) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(fill = log(pm_standard), geometry = geometry)) +
  geom_sf() +
  coord_sf(
    xlim = c(-125, -65), 
    ylim = c(20, 50)
  ) + 
  theme_void() + 
  scale_fill_viridis("Log of days over\nPM 2.5 standard", option = "inferno") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of PM 2.5 pollution") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

p3 + p4
```

@fig-days-over-relationship shows the relationship between the days over the ozone and PM 2.5 standard. There is a positive relationship between the two air quality indicators, indicating that counties with worse ozone pollution generally also have worse PM 2.5 pollution. This is consistent with research about the sources of ozone and PM 2.5 pollution, as they can both originate from nitrogen oxides from power plants, industrial pollution, and automobiles.[^6]

However, there are a large number of counties that report having 0 days over the PM 2.5 standard while having several days over the ozone standard and several counties that report having 0 days over the ozone standard while having several days over the PM 2.5 standard. This is also consistent with research showing that these pollutants also have sources that produce one pollutant, but not the other. For example, construction sites, unpaved roads, fields, smokestacks and fires produce PM 2.5 pollution, but not ozone pollution.[^7]
