## Overview

This project is looking to explore air quality, pollution, and health outcomes by county across the United States.

## Structure

### Main folder

Exploratory data analysis was completed in the order of the numbered .R scripts. There are separate .R scripts for functions used to clean and join the data, for bivariate analysis, and multivariate analysis.

Progress memos 1 and 2, along with the final report and executive summary are also in the main folder.

### Data

Raw data can be found in `/data/raw`. 

A cleaned and joined dataset, `full_air_quality_data.rda`, and codebook, `codebook.csv` is located in the `/data` folder.
