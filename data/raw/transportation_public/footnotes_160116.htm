													<li><p>Manmade geographic boundaries and their names are not static. Substantial changes to county or county-equivalent entities that affect these data during a particular decade may be found on the Census website at <a title="County Changes" href="https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/county-changes.html" target="_blank">https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/county-changes.html</a>.

				<h3>Blanks or Missing Data</h3>
				<p>Blanks or missing data within the maps, tables, and charts may be due to one of the following reasons: (1) data were not collected, (2) data were collected but were not provided to CDC, or (3) data were incomplete or did not meet data quality standards.</p>

				<h3>Data Differences</h3>
				<p>Data presented on CDC's Tracking Network may differ from data that are presented on state or city tracking networks, state or city health department websites, and other source websites for the same measures. The differences may occur for many reasons, such as use of different population estimates, differences in processes and timing for updating data, or differences in how a measure is defined for environmental public health tracking purposes. Consult the indicators and measures descriptions and metadata that are provided on this site for more information.</p>

				<p><b>Purpose</b></p>
				<p><p>This indicator should be used to understand the use of different commute options at different geographic scales: census tract, county, and state. It should be understood in the context of public health challenges of physical inactivity, obesity, diabetes, and respiratory illnesses such as asthma. This indicator can be used to identify communities that have more walking, bicycling, and public transportation trips that can serve as an example to model policies and provisions to promote active and public transportation. Alternately this indicator can be used to identify communities with poor infrastructure and lacking policies that support active or public transportation. Communities can use this indicator to advocate for resources or behavior change to improve rates of walking, bicycling, and public transit use. </p><p>These data can serve as a benchmark to demonstrate the impact that changes in means of transportation to work can have on related variables, such as air pollution, levels of physical activity, and traffic safety over time. An increase in the distribution of types of transportation to work indicates that there are policies and provisions in place within communities that support use of public transportation and active commuting. </p><p>This indicator should not be used to reflect transportation choice for all trips.</p></p>

				<p><b>Derivation of measure</b></p>
				<p><p>These measures use the number of people within each type of transportation to work per geographic area population estimate to generate the number and percent of people aged 16 and older in a given geographic area who used a specific type of transportation to commute to work. The types of transportation to work data were derived from the five-year estimates of <a href="https://www.census.gov/acs/www/" target="_blank">American Community Survey</a> (ACS).</p></p>

Individual preferences also influence commute choices, not just community design. Commuting by taxicab or "other means" as defined by the American Community Survey is not captured with this data set.</p></p>
