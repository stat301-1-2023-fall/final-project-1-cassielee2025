				<h3>Blanks or Missing Data</h3>
				<p>Blanks or missing data within the maps, tables, and charts may be due to one of the following reasons: (1) data were not collected, (2) data were collected but were not provided to CDC, or (3) data were incomplete or did not meet data quality standards.</p>

				<h3>Data Differences</h3>
				<p>Data presented on CDC's Tracking Network may differ from data that are presented on state or city tracking networks, state or city health department websites, and other source websites for the same measures. The differences may occur for many reasons, such as use of different population estimates, differences in processes and timing for updating data, or differences in how a measure is defined for environmental public health tracking purposes. Consult the indicators and measures descriptions and metadata that are provided on this site for more information.</p>

				<p><b>Purpose</b></p>
				<p><p>These measures can be used to estimate population exposure to traffic-related pollutants.</p><p>A decrease in the number of schools in an area over time within 150 meters of a major highway may indicate that there are policies in place that provide incentives to build or keep schools in residential areas or to prevent schools from being built in areas that can only be accessed by motor vehicles. Other implications of the measure could be to help identify areas where residents or students may have a higher risk for asthma along with other respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.</p></p>

				<p><b>Derivation of measure</b></p>
				<p><p>Highways in these measures are defined as major roadways and freeways that connect inter-state and inter-metropolitan areas and are identified by selecting class 0, 1, and 2 roadways as determined by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Functional Classification System.<strong><sup>1</sup></strong> After identification, a 150-meter buffer is placed around the selected road types. Public schools, using National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) data, are then identified within the 150-meter buffer for all census tracts and aggregated to the county and state levels. The percent of public schools within 150 meters of a major highway is calculated by dividing the number of schools within 150 meters of a highway for each geography (i.e., census tract, county, state) by the total number of schools within that census tract, county, or state.</p><p>Population data using 5-year census tract estimates from the American Community Survey is used to determine the number of people that live within the 150-meter highway buffer for all census tracts. The proportion of people living within the buffer for a census tract is determined using the area-proportion technique, which calculates the proportion of the tract that is within 150 meters of a highway and multiplies that proportion by the population of the tract to get the number of people living within the 150-meter buffer for each tract. These estimates are then summed to the county and state levels. The percent of people living near a major highway is calculated by dividing the number of people living within 150 meters of a highway for each geography (i.e., census tract, county, state) by the total number of schools within that census tract, county, or state.</p></p>

				<p><p><u>Highway data</u>: Though the FWHA standards used to identify major highways for both the NAVTEQ and TomTom datasets were the same, the types of roads identified by NAVTEQ and TomTom as major highways may differ between datasets due to the use of different classification systems by each data source.</p><p><u>School data</u>: The National Center for Educational Statistics dataset provides street address information that is converted to a latitude and longitude representing school locations as a single point. Representing schools as a single point makes their spatial information sensitive to even small fluctuations in geocoding accuracy. Additionally, data entry errors and omissions may be inherent in the data.</p><p><u>Population data</u>: ACS 5-Year Estimates were used to calculate these measures as the ACS population data allows for updates to this measure every 5 years. Calculating this measure using Decennial Census data may lead to variations in estimates. </p></p>

				<p><b>Use Constraints</b></p>
				<p><p>The area-proportion technique used to determine the number of people residing within a specified distance of a major highway assumes that populations are distributed evenly within census tracts. However, census tracts vary in size, shape, and how the population is distributed within them.</p><p>Estimates are dependent upon the software employed. Potential variations in estimates can occur due to rounding of the estimates during the aggregation process. We attempted to limit rounding errors by reserving rounding until all calculations and aggregations were complete.</p><p>Proximity to traffic is a measure that can approximate exposure to traffic-related air pollution, but the size of potential exposure zones and levels of exposure can vary considerably depending on the pollutant, traffic volume, ambient pollution concentrations, meteorologic conditions, topography, land use, and time spent in areas close to highways.</p></p>
