				<h3>Blanks or Missing Data</h3>
				<p>Blanks or missing data within the maps, tables, and charts may be due to one of the following reasons: (1) data were not collected, (2) data were collected but were not provided to CDC, or (3) data were incomplete or did not meet data quality standards.</p>

				<h3>Data Differences</h3>
				<p>Data presented on CDC's Tracking Network may differ from data that are presented on state or city tracking networks, state or city health department websites, and other source websites for the same measures. The differences may occur for many reasons, such as use of different population estimates, differences in processes and timing for updating data, or differences in how a measure is defined for environmental public health tracking purposes. Consult the indicators and measures descriptions and metadata that are provided on this site for more information.</p>

				<p><b>Derivation of measure</b></p>
				<p><p>PM2.5 and O<sub>3</sub> concentration data derived from reference-grade air quality monitors are acquired from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Air Quality System (AQS). The following process is used to develop county-level estimates.</p><p><em>Derivation of measures that only use monitor data (&ldquo;O3: Number of Days over Air Quality Standard (Monitor Data)&rdquo; and &ldquo;PM2.5: Percent of Days over Air Quality Standard (Monitor Data)&rdquo;).</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Step 1:&nbsp; Daily average PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations (&micro;g/m<sup>3</sup>; parameter code: '88101'), daily maximum 8-hour average ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) concentrations (ppm; parameter code: &lsquo;44201&rsquo;), and supplemental data fields (e.g., latitude, longitude) for all the monitoring sites across the US are acquired from the EPA's AQS Data Mart. The data are obtained only from monitors that are designated as Federal Reference Methods or equivalent. The data include any flagged values associated with exceptional events (high winds, fires, construction, etc.) regardless of concurrence by the EPA Regional Office.&nbsp; EPA retains data from monitors that meet the minimum data completeness criteria set forth in the national ambient air quality standard for PM<sub>2.5</sub> (40 CFR Part 50, Appendix N) and ozone (40 CFR Part 50, Appendix U).</p><p>Please note that because ozone levels decrease significantly in cold weather, ozone is monitored only during the ozone season, which is defined on a state-by-state basis. Counties that had at least 75% of the days monitored during the ozone season were considered complete. For PM2.5, only counties with year-round monitoring were included. Measures were only generated for counties that that satisfy the completeness criteria.&nbsp;</p><p><p>Step 2: The maximum daily concentration of PM2.5 and ozone are determined at each monitoring site where multiple monitors are located. The pollutant occurrence code (poc) distinguishes monitors at a monitoring site.</p><p><p>Step 3: The maximum PM2.5 and ozone concentration among all monitors within each county are determined for each monitored day. The total annual number of days above the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) is calculated by summing the number of days each year in which the maximum 8-hour ozone concentration within each county exceeded the 8-hr NAAQS of 0.070 ppm (pollutant standard id: &lsquo;23&rsquo;) and summing the number of days each year in which the maximum PM2.5 concentration within each county exceeded the 24-hr PM2.5 NAAQS of 35 mg/m<sup>3</sup> (pollutant standard id: '21').</p><p>Step 4: The annual percent of days over the 24-hr NAAQS for PM2.5 is calculated by dividing the total number of days above the NAAQS (determined in step 3) by the total number of monitored days and multiplying this exceedance fraction by 100.</p><p><em>Derivation of measures that combine monitor and modeled data (&rdquo;O3: Number of Days over Air Quality Standard (Monitor + Modeled Data)&rdquo; and &ldquo;PM2.5: Percent of Days over Air Quality Standard (Monitor + Modeled Data)&rdquo;).</em></p><p>Many US counties and census tracts do not have sufficient air quality monitoring to derive concentration estimates from monitor data alone. To fill these gaps, the monitor data are supplemented with modeled estimates derived from the Downscaler (DS) model, which is a statistical fusion of monitoring data and Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeled outputs (1). DS modeled estimates are available by census tract centroid&mdash;the geographic center of the census tract. Daily county-level modeled estimates are obtained by selecting the maximum concentration of PM2.5 and ozone among all the census tracts within each county, and daily census tract-level modeled estimates are obtained by selecting the maximum concentration for each census tract. The &ldquo;Monitor + Modeled Data&rdquo; measures include monitor data in counties with sufficient monitor observations and DS modeled estimates for locations lacking monitor data. All census tract-level data are modeled data only.</p></p>

			<div class="panel-body">
				<p><b>Use Constraints</b></p>
				<p><ul><li>The number of days that exceed the NAAQS does not provide information regarding the severity (i.e., maximum concentrations) of potential exposures. The relationship between outdoor ambient concentrations, indoor air pollution, and individual exposures are active subjects of ongoing research, and likely vary depending upon pollutant, behavioral patterns, and microenvironments.</li></ul><ul><li>The number or percent of days in which NAAQS are exceeded may differ substantially year-to-year and may not reflect worsening or improving pollution levels. For example, annual variability may be the result of meteorological conditions (e.g., temperature and mixing heights) and/or random chance (e.g., a random two day increase in NAAQS exceedance could represent a significant relative increase as these events may be relatively rare in some locations).</li></ul><ul><li>Larger areas will tend to have a more variation in pollution concentrations and thus daily estimates of maximum concentrations for larger counties or census tracts may be biased higher than estimates for smaller counties or census tracts.</li></ul><ul><li>Since ozone levels decrease significantly in the colder parts of the year in many areas, ozone is required to be monitored only during the warmer &ldquo;ozone season.&rdquo; Ozone seasons are designated on a state-by-state basis (7). Due to the relationship between ozone concentrations and temperature, there may be more days in which NAAQS are exceeded in warmer locations and/or time periods.</li></ul><ul><li>For measures estimating PM2.5 NAAQS exceedance, the percent of days exceeding the standard was used rather than the total number of days (as in the ozone measures) due to differences in PM2.5 monitor operating Most operate once every three days, and a small proportion operate daily or once every sixth day. Because most monitors do not take measurements every day, the true number of days in which the NAAQS are exceeded is uncertain. To address this issue, the percent of days exceeding the NAAQS was used with the number of monitored days serving as the denominator rather than the total number of days in the year.</li></ul><p>This indicator cannot be used to assess NAAQS compliance or to evaluate progress toward attaining compliance.</p></p>
