				<h3>Blanks or Missing Data</h3>
				<p>Blanks or missing data within the maps, tables, and charts may be due to one of the following reasons: (1) data were not collected, (2) data were collected but were not provided to CDC, or (3) data were incomplete or did not meet data quality standards.</p>

				<h3>Data Differences</h3>
				<p>Data presented on CDC's Tracking Network may differ from data that are presented on state or city tracking networks, state or city health department websites, and other source websites for the same measures. The differences may occur for many reasons, such as use of different population estimates, differences in processes and timing for updating data, or differences in how a measure is defined for environmental public health tracking purposes. Consult the indicators and measures descriptions and metadata that are provided on this site for more information.</p>

			<div class="panel-body">
				<p><b>Purpose</b></p>
				<p><p>Communities must prepare for and respond to hazardous events, whether a natural disaster like a tornado or a disease outbreak, or an anthropogenic event such as a harmful chemical spill. The degree to which a community exhibits certain social conditions, including high poverty, low percentage of vehicle access, or crowded households, may affect that community&#39;s ability to prevent human suffering and financial loss in the event of disaster. These factors describe a community&#39;s social vulnerability.</p><p>ATSDR&#39;s Geospatial Research, Analysis & Services Program (GRASP) has created a tool to help public health officials and emergency response planners identify and map the communities that will most likely need support before, during, and after a hazardous event.</p><p>The Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) indicates the relative vulnerability of every U.S. Census tract. Census tracts are subdivisions of counties for which the Census collects statistical data. The SVI ranks the tracts on 15 social factors, including unemployment, minority status, and disability, and further groups them into four related themes. Thus each tract receives a ranking for each Census variable and for each of the four themes, as well as an overall ranking.</p></p>

				<p><b>Derivation of measure</b></p>
				<p><p>The Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) uses U.S. Census data to determine the social vulnerability of every Census tract. Census tracts are subdivisions of counties for which the Census collects statistical data. The SVI ranks each tract on 15 social factors*, including poverty, lack of vehicle access, and crowded housing, and groups them into four related themes:</p><ol><li>Socioeconomic percentile vulnerability</li><li>Household composition/disability percentile**</li><li>Minority Status/Language percentile</li><li>Housing/Transportation percentile</li></ol>
<p>Maps of the four themes are shown in the figure in the SVI Factsheet: <a href="https://svi.cdc.gov/Documents/FactSheet/SVIFactSheet.pdf" target="_blank">https://svi.cdc.gov/Documents/FactSheet/SVIFactSheet.pdf</a>. Each tract receives a separate ranking for each of the four themes, as well as an overall ranking.</p>
<p>*2010 SVI ranks are based on 14 factors. 2010 Census data do not contain data on disabilities.<br>**For 2010, the Household composition/disability percentile does not include disability due to the lack of data mentioned above.</p></p>

				<p><p>Each year, the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program (PEP) utilizes current data on births, deaths, and migration to calculate population change since the most recent decennial census and produce a time series of estimates of population, demographic components of change, and housing units. The annual time series of estimates begins with the most recent decennial census data and extends to the vintage year. For detailed information about the methods used to create the population estimates, see <a title="Methodology" href="http://www.census.gov/popest/methodology/index.html" target="_blank">Methodology</a>.</p><p>Manmade geographic boundaries and their names are not static. Substantial changes to county or county equivalent entities that affect these data during a particular decade may be found on the Census website at <a title="County Changes" href="https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/county-changes.html" target="_blank">https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/county-changes.html</a>. Data comparisons in these areas should be conducted with these changes in mind.</p><p>The American Community Survey (ACS) data is used in estimating characteristic distributions. It is also important to keep in mind that all ACS data are estimates. Data is collected from a sample of the population in the United States and Puerto Rico rather than from the whole population. To help interpret the reliability of the estimates, the Census Bureau publishes a margin of error (MOE) for every ACS estimate.&nbsp; Guidance for Data Users of ACS can be found: <a title="ACS Guidance" href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/guidance.html" target="_blank">https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/guidance.html</a>.</p></p>

				<p><b>Use Constraints</b></p>
				<p><p>Social vulnerability is complex, and cross sectional indexes such as the SVI are merely estimates; there are likely additional place-based factors contributing to community level social vulnerability not included in SVI estimates. Further, these factors might be different across space and time.</p>
<p>The SVI is only an estimate of aggregate vulnerability, and as such is not appropriate for individual-level analysis.</p>
<p>While census data remains the best available, the census fails to include information on critically vulnerable populations, such as the homeless.</p>
<p>Index results are estimates and should be treated as such.</p>
