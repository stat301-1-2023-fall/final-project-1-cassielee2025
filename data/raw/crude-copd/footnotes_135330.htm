													<li><p>Data are from the Population Level Analysis and Community Estimates (PLACES) Project (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/places/index.html">https://www.cdc.gov/places/index.html</a>), which is an expansion of the original 500 Cities Project. The original project was launched by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in partnerships with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) and CDC Foundation.</p></li>
													<li><p>The PLACES data are small area estimations generated using a multi-level statistical modeling framework. The primary data sources are the CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, the Census 2010 population, and the American Community Survey estimates. Refer to the places site for more information about the methods used. (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/places/methodology/index.html">https://www.cdc.gov/places/methodology/index.html</a>)</p></li>
													<li><p>The PLACES data is viewed by county or census tract geographical level.</p><p>&nbsp;County: 3,142 counties within 50 states and District of Columbia (D.C.), including nine county and city consolidated cities.</p><p>&nbsp;Census Tract: 72,337 of 73,057 census tracts in the 50 states and Washington D.C. that have a Census 2010 population of 50 or more people. Compared with the original 500 Cities Project in which estimates were made only for the part of the tracts within cities, this project will provide the estimate for the entire census tract regardless of city boundaries.</p></li>
													<li><p>The current modeling procedure does not support using the estimates to track changes at the local level over time because the 2010 US Census was used for all census tract estimates.</p></li>
													<li><p>Estimates for New Jersey are not available for measures based on BRFSS 2019. The state did not collect enough BRFSS data to meet the minimum requirements for inclusion in the 2019 annual aggregate dataset.</p></li>

				<h3>Blanks or Missing Data</h3>
				<p>Blanks or missing data within the maps, tables, and charts may be due to one of the following reasons: (1) data were not collected, (2) data were collected but were not provided to CDC, or (3) data were incomplete or did not meet data quality standards.</p>

				<h3>Data Differences</h3>
				<p>Data presented on CDC's Tracking Network may differ from data that are presented on state or city tracking networks, state or city health department websites, and other source websites for the same measures. The differences may occur for many reasons, such as use of different population estimates, differences in processes and timing for updating data, or differences in how a measure is defined for environmental public health tracking purposes. Consult the indicators and measures descriptions and metadata that are provided on this site for more information.</p>

BRFSS data are self-reported and reflect the perceptions of respondents. An advantage of self-reports is that they can reveal information that cannot be obtained from other sources; for example, the receipt of flu vaccinations for people who do not see a doctor during the year. A disadvantage of self-report data is that respondents may have difficulty recalling events, understanding or interpreting questions, or responding truthfully to questions. Furthermore, cultural and language barriers and limited health knowledge can affect the quality of self-reported data. These problems may affect some subgroups more than others.  
</p>
<p>
Until 2009, households without a land-line telephone did not have the opportunity to participate in the BRFSS survey. Telephone coverage varies by state and by subpopulation. Telephone coverage averages 97.6% for the United States as a whole, but non-coverage ranges from 1.1% in Connecticut and New Hampshire, to 6.6% in Mississippi. An estimated 23.8% of households in Puerto Rico are without telephone service. Data on telephone coverage in U.S. households are available at <a href="http://factfinder.census.gov">http://factfinder.census.gov</a>. 
</p>
<p>
In 2009, the BRFSS implemented the Cell Phone Survey in all states and territories. By including cell phones in the survey, BRFSS is able to reach segments of the population that were previously inaccessible—those who have a cell phone but not a landline—and produce a more representative sample and higher quality data. Due to changes in sampling and weighting methodology, 2011 is a new baseline for BRFSS, and comparisons with prior year data are inappropriate.

				<p><p>
BRFSS does not measure stroke prevalence among institutionalized adults, the military, persons aged <18 years, and residents without telephones. Stroke prevalence in households without telephones might be different than in those with telephones. This may also be different between institutionalized individuals and those who are not.
</p>
<p>
The validity of self-reported stroke status in BRFSS is unknown. BRFSS case definitions include respondents who have been told by a physician they had a stroke; either the physician's diagnosis or the respondent's recall of that diagnosis might be inaccurate. 
</p>
<p>
Limitations of the PLACES Project data measures are outlined in the measure definitions page of the PLACES Project website under the “Limitations of Indicator” portion of the measure documentation:
<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/places/measure-definitions/index.html">https://www.cdc.gov/places/measure-definitions/index.html</a>
</p>
<p>
The primary data sources are CDC PLACES, CDC BRFSS, the U.S. Census Bureau 2010 population and American Community Survey estimates.
