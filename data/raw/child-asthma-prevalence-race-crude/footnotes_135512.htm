													<li><p>Data are from the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/">Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS)</a>, a state-based, random-digit-dial telephone survey of the non-institutionalized, civilian U.S. population 18 years of age and older. BRFSS data are self-reported.</p></li>
													<li><p>Prior to 2011 households without a land-line telephone did not have the opportunity to participate in the survey. Telephone coverage varies by state and also by subpopulation. In 2011 and forward, households without a land-line telephone, but with cellular phones have the opportunity to participate in the survey. This change may prevent the comparison of pre-2011 survey results with results from surveys in 2011 and forward.</p></li>
													<li><p>BRFSS data are self-reported. The case definition includes respondents who have been told by a physician they have asthma; either the physician's diagnosis or the respondent's recall of that diagnosis might be inaccurate.</p></li>
													<li><p>In 2005, there was a change in the administration of the children's BRFSS module which prevents the comparison of pre-2005 survey results with results from surveys in 2005 and forward. </p></li>

													<li><p>In 2011, new weighting methodology was used to calculate the final weights for the BRFSS data which prevents the comparison of pre-2011 survey results with results from surveys in 2011 and forward.</p></li>

				<p><b>Purpose</b></p>
				<p><p>These measures can assist by addressing the following surveillance functions:</p><ul><li>What's the distribution of reported asthma by state of residence? </li><li>Are there seasonal or temporal trends in the way people are responding to questions about asthma?</li><li>How does the reported asthma differ between geographic areas (e.g., state)? </li><li>With further analysis, are there disparities in asthma hospitalizations by factors such as age, race, ethnicity, gender, education, and/or income? </li><li>Which populations are in need of targeted interventions? </li><li>When asthma data are linked with environmental variables, do the linked measures identify environmental relationships that warrant further investigation or environmental public health action? </li><li>Planning and evaluating efforts to reduce the health burden from this disease.  </li></ul>
<p>The PLACES data can be used to</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify the health issues facing a local area or neighborhoods</li>

				<p><b>Derivation of measure</b></p>
				<p><p><strong>Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)</strong></p><p>These measures are derived from Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data, which is a state-based, random-digit--dialed telephone survey of the non-institutionalized, civilian U.S. population aged &ge;18 years. The survey collects information about modifiable risk factors for chronic diseases and other leading causes of death and is administered in English and Spanish.</p><p>Lifetime asthma is defined as an affirmative response to the question &ldquo;Have you ever been told by a doctor {nurse or other health professional} that you have asthma?&rdquo; Current asthma is defined as an affirmative response to that question followed by an affirmative response to the subsequent question &ldquo;Do you still have asthma?&rdquo;</p><p>Sample weights were assigned based on BRFSS methodology. Weighted prevalence estimates and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using SUDAAN to account for the complex survey design.</p><p>The weighting methodology for BRFSS changed from post-stratification to raking starting in 2011. Detailed information about BRFSS weighting methodology can be accessed here:</p><ul><li>for data collected from 2011 and after: <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/2011/2011_weighting.htm">http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/2011/2011_weighting.htm</a></li></ul><p><strong>Asthma Call-Back Survey (ACBS)</strong></p><p>The Asthma Call-back Survey (ACBS) is a product of CDC&rsquo;s National Asthma Control Program (NACP).</p><p>Asthma diagnosis in the past 5 years was determined using the question &ldquo;How old were you when you were first told by a doctor or other health professional that you had asthma?&rdquo; and &ldquo;How long ago was that?&rdquo; Active asthma attack in the past 12 months was determined using the question &ldquo;During the past 12 months, have you had an episode of asthma or an asthma attack?&rdquo; Active asthma with one or more routine doctor&rsquo;s visit in the past year was estimated using question &ldquo;During the past 12 months how many times did you see a doctor or other health professional for a routine checkup for your asthma?&rdquo;</p><p>To produce the ACBS final weight, the BRFSS final weight is adjusted for loss of sample between the BRFSS interview and the ACBS interview. Weighted ACBS data represent results that have been adjusted to compensate for nonresponse at the BRFSS interview and at the ACBS interview.&nbsp; For further details regarding the ACBS final weight, refer to the document entitled &ldquo;Asthma Call Back Weighting Method,&rdquo; which can be requested from NCEH/EHHE/APRHB (asthmacallbackinfo@cdc.gov).</p><p><strong>PLACES</strong></p><p>The PLACES Project is an expansion of the original 500 Cities Project. PLACES data are small area estimations using multi-level statistical modeling framework. The primary data sources are the CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), the Census 2010 population, and the American Community Survey estimates. Refer to the PLACES site for more information about the method used (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/places/methodology/index.html">https://www.cdc.gov/places/methodology/index.html</a>) and find more details about each specific measure (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/places/measure-definitions/index.html">https://www.cdc.gov/places/measure-definitions/index.html</a>).</p></p>

				<p><b></b></p>
				<p><p><strong>Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System (BRFSS)</strong></p><p>BRFSS data are self-reported and reflect the perceptions of respondents. A disadvantage of self-report data is that respondents may have difficulty recalling events, understanding or interpreting questions, or responding truthfully to questions. Furthermore, cultural and language barriers and limited health knowledge can affect the quality of self-reported data. These problems may affect some subgroups more than others.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Asthma Call-Back Survey (ACBS)</strong></p><p>The Institutional Review Board (IRB) in some states required that asthma be mentioned when the BRFSS respondent was asked to participate in the ACBS.&nbsp; Other states required that asthma not be mentioned.&nbsp; Some state IRBs required that BRFSS respondents be specifically asked if their BRFSS responses could be linked to their ACBS responses.&nbsp; Other state IRBs did not.&nbsp; If a state required active consent to link the responses from the two interviews, the PERMISS variable on the data file will be coded 1 for yes.&nbsp; If consent was denied, the ACBS was not conducted and there will be no record in the file.&nbsp; Wording for specific consent scripts can be obtained from each participating state.&nbsp;</p><p>Several states ask the ACBS consent questions directly after the asthma questions in the core of the BRFSS survey. Other states ask the consent questions at the end of the BRFSS interview.</p><p>Approximately 3% of the ACBS interviews are completed in the calendar year following the BRFSS interview. The Variable IYEAR_F identifies the year of the call-back interview.</p></p>

				<p><b>Use Constraints</b></p>
				<p><p>BRFSS and ACBS do not measure asthma prevalence among institutionalized adults, the military, persons aged &lt;18 years, and residents without telephones. Asthma prevalence in households without telephones might be different than in those with telephones.</p>
<p>The validity of self-reported asthma status in BRFSS is unknown. BRFSS case definitions include respondents who have been told by a physician they have asthma; either the physician's diagnosis or the respondent's recall of that diagnosis might be inaccurate. </p>
