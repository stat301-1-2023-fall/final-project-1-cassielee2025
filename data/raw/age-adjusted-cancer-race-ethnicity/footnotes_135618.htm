													<li><p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/uscs">U.S. Cancer Statistics</a> data are provided by <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/npcr/">CDC's National Program of Cancer Registries</a> as submitted to CDC and NCI in the most recent data submission.</p></li>
													<li><p>Incidence rates (cases per 100,000 population per year) are age-adjusted to the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.seer.cancer.gov/stdpopulations/stdpop.19ages.html">2000 US standard population</a>&nbsp;(19 age groups: less than 1, 1-4, 5-9, ... , 80-84, 85+). Rates are for invasive cancer only (except for bladder cancer which includes invasive and in situ) or unless otherwise specified. Population counts for denominators are based on Census populations as modified by NCI.</p></li>
													<li><p>Using U.S. Cancer Statistics methods, data have been suppressed to ensure confidentiality and stability of rate estimates. Data are suppressed if fewer than 16 cases were reported in a specific population category or where there are 100 or fewer persons in the denominator.</p></li>
													<li><p>Rates with hatching in maps and charts or written in red on the table are considered unstable because the relative standard error is greater than 30%.</p></li>
													<li><p>Benchmarks are provided for all cancer rate measures. State benchmarks will appear when county-level data are displayed; national benchmarks will appear when state-level data are displayed. Data from all 50 U.S. states and D.C. are included in the calculation of the national benchmarks. </p></li>

				<h3>Blanks or Missing Data</h3>
				<p>Blanks or missing data within the maps, tables, and charts may be due to one of the following reasons: (1) data were not collected, (2) data were collected but were not provided to CDC, or (3) data were incomplete or did not meet data quality standards.</p>

				<h3>Data Differences</h3>
				<p>Data presented on CDC's Tracking Network may differ from data that are presented on state or city tracking networks, state or city health department websites, and other source websites for the same measures. The differences may occur for many reasons, such as use of different population estimates, differences in processes and timing for updating data, or differences in how a measure is defined for environmental public health tracking purposes. Consult the indicators and measures descriptions and metadata that are provided on this site for more information.</p>

			<div class="panel-body">
				<p><b>Purpose</b></p>
				<p><p>Allow for a better understanding of spatial and temporal patterns of selected cancers suggested to be linked to environmental exposures within states. The number of cases provides cancer burden for a specific geography and/or population subgroup; age-adjusted rates allow people to compare cancer occurrence across larger geographic areas and/or population subgroups. Such information is vital for hypothesis generating and further developing linkage studies to evaluate environmental impacts on cancer.</p></p>

				<p><b>Derivation of measure</b></p>
				<p><p>The numerator is composed of counts of unique invasive primary incident cases of cancer diagnosed during a specified calendar year within residents of a specified geographic region. New cancer case (incidence) data are submitted by central cancer registries to either or both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&rsquo;s (CDC) <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/npcr">National Program of Cancer Registries</a> (NPCR) or the National Cancer Institute&rsquo;s (NCI) <a href="https://seer.cancer.gov/about/overview.html">Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program</a> (SEER).</p><p>For state and county data, the denominator is composed of age-, race-, ethnicity-, and sex-specific counts of the population residing in the geographic region of interest as of a specified date. <a href="https://seer.cancer.gov/popdata/">These populations are modifications to the intercensal and Vintage county population estimates by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin produced by NCI</a>. For sub-county data prior to 2020, the denominator is composed of sex-specific count of population residing in the geographic region of interest as of the 2010 Decennial Census. Population data were originally collected by the U.S. Census.</p><p>Rates are age-adjusted to year 2000 U.S. standard population.</p></p>

				<p><p>CDC and NCI support the data collection and quality standards in the <a href="https://www.naaccr.org/">North American Association of Central Cancer Registries</a> (NAACCR) consensus documents. During data collection, CDC and NCI also apply additional rigorous quality control edits, data completeness evaluations, and data quality assessments. For a registry&rsquo;s data to be included in the U.S. Cancer Statistics data products, they must meet the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/npcr/standards.htm">U.S. Cancer Statistics publication standard</a>.</p><p>State cancer registry programs vary regarding the availability and quality of residential address information collected and completeness of geocoding efforts.</p></p>

			<div class="panel-body">
				<p><b>Use Constraints</b></p>
				<p><p>Counts and rates are calculated based on residential address at time of diagnosis. No information is available on prior residences.</p><p>Geocoding accuracy, level of geocoding, and geocoding completeness may vary by time and space. This could potentially create geographically non-random errors in calculated rates of cancer.</p><p>No personal exposure information will be available, including smoking history, diet, lifestyle, or personal or family history of cancer.</p><p>Case counts less than 16 and rates based on counts less than 16 are suppressed to protect confidentiality and to prevent misinterpretation of unstable rates. Additionally, case counts and rates are suppressed in geographies with 100 or fewer persons. For sub-county cancer data, complementary suppression is applied to both male and female counts when either sex has fewer than 16 cases.</p><p>No information will be available on the latency of cancer cases.</p><p>The Tracking Program&rsquo;s sub-county geographies are created using populations of the U.S Decennial Census. Measures toward the end of the decade may be less reliable as population shift occurs.</p><p>Limitations associated with the sub-county aggregation methodology are described in <a href="https://github.com/CDCgov/EPHTracking-Subcounty">our GitHub repository</a>.</p></p>
